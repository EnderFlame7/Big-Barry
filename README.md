# Big-Barry

Big Barry was developed for the GMTK Game Jam 2024, the largest game jam of the year,
lasting 4 days with the theme built to scale. In the game, players control a balloon
that inflates to grow and float or deflates to shrink and move. Players must navigate
through dangerous rooms filled with obstacles, buttons, and doors, aiming to escape as
quickly as possible.

The game features 9 unique levels and 3 types of button-door mechanics. It emphasized
level design, debugging, and back tracing, with plans for an online leaderboard that
was scrapped due to time constraints. The game ranked 1009th out of 7,626 entries and
442nd in creativity.
